Example 3
This examples demonstrate the FreeMaster Application use with GPIO Peripheral.
FreeMAster Application is integrated over the GPIO Example 1.
In GPIO Example 1: We have configured 2 pins as input, which are used as switches.
And we have configured 2 pins as outputs, which are used as LEDS.
when we press the swicthes, LEDs attached to 2 Pins of MCU are made to Glow On and Off.

The States of LEDS are stored in a variable: Red_Led_State and Green_Led_State.
These 2 variables are mapped on FreeMaster in its oscillscope and recorder event.
