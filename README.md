ElecronicsV2: Arduino of Automotive World

This is the Git repo for Embedded Software Support and resources on the ElecronicsV2 Development Board.
Which is often abbreviated as the "Arduino of Automotive World".

In the Repo Initially, you will find there are 3 folders created:
1) Peripheral Drivers
2) Sensor_Module_Interfacing
3) DIY Projects

In Peripheral Driver: there are Examples for all the peripherals of the S32K144 MCUâ€”enablement of all the peripherals, using the NXP S32K1 SDK.\
In Sensor_Module_Interfacing: Different kinds of Sensor and Modules interfaced to S32K1 MCUs exist. There is device driver development of many sensors and modules of different industries and
applications: Automotive, Industrial Automation, Avionics, IoT, Motor Driver, etc.
In DIY Projects: You will see the integration of Different sensor modules into one project. To make different Industrial DIY Projects.

This is the initial commit and readme, with time many changes are going to take place.
